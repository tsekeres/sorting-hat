Name of the Project:
Sorting Hat

Overview of the project:
This project is a SPA that welcomes students to Hogwarts and allows them to put their name in a sorting algorithm to see what house they will be assigned to. When they are sorted a card appears with their house crest and attributes common amoung those house members. If the student is expelled with the button on their card they are given a new card signifying that they are now a Death Eater.
